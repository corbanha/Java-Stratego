# Java-Stratego

This is a Graphical User Interface Java game that I wrote for the final AP Computer Science class in High School. Stratego is a classic board game where are commanding an army involving spys and other characters and are trying to get the enemies flag whilst avoiding bombs and other things. I've built this program as a single player game where you play against an extremely simple AI.
